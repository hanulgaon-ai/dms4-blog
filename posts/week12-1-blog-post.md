# Week 12-1 Blog

## Inclusion as Creative Coding's Foundation

Creative coding sits at the intersection of art and technology, but its current structure often reproduces the exclusions present in both fields. Inclusion should be a core structural pillar, not an afterthought.

### Digital Infrastructure Barriers

Creative coding requires significant digital infrastructure - powerful computers, reliable internet, software licenses. This creates immediate barriers for communities without economic resources. When we build creative coding education around expensive tools, we're essentially gatekeeping based on class.

My CheckMate project highlighted this during user testing. Roommates with older phones struggled with React Native performance, while those with newer devices had smooth experiences. The technology itself was creating inequality within our small community.

### Motivation and Access

Intrinsic motivation for creative coding often emerges from seeing possibilities - "I could make that!" But if the tools and examples predominantly reflect privileged perspectives, many potential creators never experience that spark.

Computer science gatekeeping compounds this through unnecessary complexity and elitist attitudes. Creative coding could bypass traditional CS education pathways, but instead often requires similar foundational knowledge that excludes many learners.

### Digital Literacy and Power

Digital literacy is increasingly required for civic participation, yet creative coding education remains concentrated in elite institutions. This creates vectoralist oppression where those who control creative tools extract value from those who can only consume.

Legislation around AI and digital rights happens without input from diverse creative communities. When creative coders aren't representative of broader society, the tools we build and advocate for reflect narrow interests.

### Network Effects and Lock-in

Dominant creative coding platforms (Adobe, proprietary software) create switching costs that trap users. Open-source alternatives exist but lack the network effects of established tools.

Interoperability becomes crucial for inclusion - people should be able to participate regardless of their platform choices. My AT3 project deliberately used web technologies to avoid iOS/Android divisions.

### Alternative Knowledge Networks

The most exciting creative coding often happens in extra-institutional spaces - online communities, maker spaces, artist collectives. These hubs often have better diversity than universities but lack resources and recognition.

The critical posthumanities offer frameworks for understanding how technology shapes society. Creative coding needs this perspective to avoid reproducing harmful power structures through seemingly neutral tools.

### Structural Changes Needed

Inclusion requires more than diverse representation in existing structures. We need:

- **Accessible tools** that work across economic and technological divides
- **Diverse problem spaces** beyond art-for-art's-sake
- **Community-centered learning** rather than individual skill acquisition
- **Critical engagement** with technology's social impacts

Creative coding could be a democratizing force, but only if inclusion becomes foundational rather than supplemental. The CheckMate project taught me that even well-intentioned technology can reproduce inequalities unless we actively design against them.

The question isn't whether we can afford to prioritize inclusion, but whether creative coding can fulfill its transformative potential without it.
