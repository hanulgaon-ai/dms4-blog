## WebRTC Integration for CheckMate

I'm exploring how WebRTC could enhance my CheckMate roommate management app by adding real-time collaboration features.

### Current Idea vs WebRTC Enhancement

**Current CheckMate:** Individual task tracking with periodic settlements
**With WebRTC:** Real-time collaborative task management with live updates

### WebRTC Implementation Ideas

**Live Task Coordination:**

```javascript
// Real-time task claiming system
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();
const dataChannel = peerConnection.createDataChannel("tasks");

dataChannel.onmessage = (event) => {
  const taskUpdate = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (taskUpdate.type === "claim") {
    updateTaskStatus(taskUpdate.taskId, taskUpdate.claimedBy);
  }
};

function claimTask(taskId) {
  dataChannel.send(
    JSON.stringify({
      type: "claim",
      taskId: taskId,
      claimedBy: currentUser,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    })
  );
}
```

**Live Settlement Sessions:**
Roommates could connect via WebRTC for monthly settlement discussions, sharing screens to review task histories and negotiate payments in real-time.

### Technical Learning Requirements

**WebRTC Fundamentals:**

- Peer-to-peer connection establishment
- STUN/TURN server configuration
- Data channel management
- Connection state handling

**Signaling Server:**

- WebSocket server for initial peer discovery
- Room management for multiple roommates
- Message routing and presence detection

```javascript
// Simple signaling server structure
const WebSocket = require("ws");
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 3001 });

const rooms = new Map();

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  ws.on("message", (data) => {
    const message = JSON.parse(data);

    if (message.type === "join-room") {
      joinRoom(ws, message.roomId);
    } else if (message.type === "offer" || message.type === "answer") {
      relayMessage(message);
    }
  });
});
```

### Additional Feasibility Requirements

**Infrastructure:**

- TURN server for NAT traversal (probably use a service like Twilio)
- Real-time database sync (Firebase or Socket.io fallback)
- Mobile app WebRTC support testing

**User Experience:**

- Connection status indicators
- Offline mode handling
- Conflict resolution when multiple people claim same task

**Security:**

- Encrypted data channels
- User authentication
- Room access control

### Mycelial Creativity Benefits

WebRTC would transform CheckMate from individual tracking to a living network that mirrors mycelial structures:

**Information Flow:** Just like mycelia share nutrients instantly across the network, roommates would share task updates in real-time. When someone starts cleaning the kitchen, others immediately know and can coordinate related tasks.

**Adaptive Response:** The system becomes responsive to collective needs. If someone's struggling with their tasks, others can see and offer help through live chat or task reassignment - similar to how fungi redirect resources to stressed areas.

**Emergent Coordination:** Instead of rigid schedules, natural collaboration patterns emerge. Roommates might discover they work well together on certain tasks, leading to spontaneous partnerships that benefit the whole household.

**Network Resilience:** Even if one person goes offline, the remaining connections maintain the collaborative flow, just like mycelial networks route around damaged sections.

This real-time interconnection would make CheckMate feel less like individual task management and more like participating in a living household ecosystem where everyone's contributions enhance the collective experience.

The transparency and immediate feedback could reduce conflicts while encouraging more generous participation - when you see others contributing in real-time, it motivates reciprocal behavior.
