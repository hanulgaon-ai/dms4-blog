# Week 11-1 Blog

## AT3 Project Plan

### Community Analysis

**Domain:** Shared household management and fair resource distribution
**Repertoire:** Task tracking, expense splitting, conflict resolution, communication protocols
**Values:** Transparency, fairness, accountability, collaborative living

### Code Implementation

Planning to use React Native for cross-platform mobile app with Node.js backend. Key features include:

- Task checklist with weighted scoring system
- Photo verification for completed tasks
- Automated cost calculation based on contribution ratios
- Monthly settlement interface

### Practical Vision

CheckMate creates transparency in roommate responsibilities. Each person logs completed tasks, the system tracks contributions over time, and monthly settlements reflect actual participation levels. This reduces conflicts by making everyone's efforts visible and quantifiable.

### Haiku Version

```
Tasks logged daily,
Fair costs flow from clear effortsâ€”
Roommates live in peace.
```

## Screen Recording Process

I recorded myself researching roommate management apps, coding basic React components, and looking up task weighting algorithms. Used OBS Studio for recording and DaVinci Resolve for editing.

**Speed Modulation:**

- Sped up general browsing (3x speed)
- Normal speed for code explanation
- Slow motion (0.5x) when showing algorithm logic

The haiku narration over ambient music creates a contemplative mood that contrasts with the technical content, highlighting how simple principles can solve complex social problems.

## Reflection

The haiku forced me to distill the essence of my project into its core purpose: creating peace through transparency. The contrast between the technical screen recording and poetic narration emphasizes how technology can serve human relationships.

Recording myself work revealed how much time I spend researching versus actually coding. The editing process helped identify the most important moments in the development workflow.
