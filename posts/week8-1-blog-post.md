# Week 8-1 Blog

## 1. Blog Upgrade Process

While attempting to upgrade my blog, I encountered an error when trying to clone the landing page repository. The error message "This folder contains files. Git can only clone to empty folders" appeared. I'll need to create an empty folder first and then try again.

## 3. AT3 Project Ideas

For my AT3 project, I'm considering creating an interactive visualization tool for my Discord gaming group that displays our communication patterns like a mycelial network.

**Why this is interesting (Ngai's aesthetic concept):**

This project connects to Ngai's "interesting" aesthetic because it reveals hidden patterns in our group's conversation and game preferences. Seeing who talks to whom most frequently and which topics generate the most discussion will create moments of discovery and insight.

The visualization will show how information flows within our community similar to how nutrients travel through fungal networks in nature. This parallel between digital human communication and natural systems offers a new perspective on our social interactions.

By implementing this with JavaScript, I can create an interactive experience that allows group members to explore and understand our community dynamics in a more intuitive way.
