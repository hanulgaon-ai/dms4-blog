# Week 1-1 Blog

As someone new to coding, I needed to first understand what coding is all about before diving into for loops.
When I asked ChatGPT about how to use for loops, it explained that for loops are useful when you need to repeat actions in coding.

First, I learned about a typical example of using for loops to create multiple rectangles in a row:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400); // Set canvas size
  noLoop(); // Set to not repeat
}

function draw() {
  background(220); // Set background to light gray
  let w = 40; // Rectangle size
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    rect(i * w, 100, w, w); // Place 10 rectangles horizontally
  }
}
```

In the code above, as i increases from 0 to 9, each rectangle is drawn using rect(), creating multiple rectangles in a row.

For my second question about how to create a grid, I learned how to use multiple for loops to repeat rectangles both horizontally and vertically. I learned about code that uses two for loops to create a grid by repeating rectangles horizontally and vertically.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400); // Set canvas size
  noLoop(); // Set to run only once
}

function draw() {
  background(220); // Set background to light gray
  let cols = 5; // Number of columns
  let rows = 5; // Number of rows
  let w = width / cols; // Width of each rectangle
  let h = height / rows; // Height of each rectangle

  for (let i = 0; i < cols; i++) {
    // Repeat horizontally
    for (let j = 0; j < rows; j++) {
      // Repeat vertically
      rect(i * w, j * h, w, h); // Draw rectangle
    }
  }
}
```

The code above creates a 5x5 grid where i and j represent columns and rows, respectively. Each rectangle's position is calculated as i _ w, j _ h. The variables w and h represent the width and height of each rectangle.

Additional note: Although I still don't fully understand coding, I became interested and wanted to create an interactive grid myself. I wanted code that would create and remove grid cells based on mouse movement. While this is just code generated by ChatGPT for now, I plan to break it down and understand it bit by bit. Here's the code ChatGPT created:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
}

function draw() {
  background(220);

  // Determine the number of columns and rows based on mouse position. Minimum value is 1
  let cols = max(1, int(mouseX / 40)); // Adjust number of columns based on mouse X coordinate
  let rows = max(1, int(mouseY / 40)); // Adjust number of rows based on mouse Y coordinate
  let w = width / cols; // Width of each rectangle
  let h = height / rows; // Height of each rectangle

  // Draw grid
  for (let i = 0; i < cols; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < rows; j++) {
      rect(i * w, j * h, w, h); // Draw rectangle
    }
  }
}
```

When I input this code into p5.js, the result was a grid that appears and disappears according to my mouse movement. The noLoop was removed from the original code, and to determine the number of columns and rows based on mouse position, the following code was used:

```javascript
let cols = max(1, int(mouseX / 40));
let rows = max(1, int(mouseY / 40));
```

And to draw the grid, this code was used:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < cols; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < rows; j++) {
      rect(i * w, j * h, w, h);
```
