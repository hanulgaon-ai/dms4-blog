## AT3 Progress Update

CheckMate development is moving forward with both technical implementation and community engagement aspects taking shape.

### Communities of Practice Analysis

**Domain:** Our roommate household operates within shared living space management - coordinating tasks, expenses, and social dynamics.

**Repertoire:** We've developed informal practices like leaving notes, splitting bills roughly, and having monthly "house meetings." CheckMate aims to digitize and improve these existing patterns.

**Values:** Fairness emerged as our core value, but we discovered underlying tensions between efficiency and inclusivity. Some roommates prefer quick decisions while others want consensus.

**Brokering:** I'm acting as a broker between our household practices and broader roommate management approaches I've researched. The app translates academic theories about fair division into practical daily routines.

### Mycelial Creativity in Development

**Omnidirectional Growth:** The project expanded beyond simple task tracking. User feedback led to features I hadn't planned: photo verification, anonymous feedback options, and integration with existing calendar apps.

**Accumulative Growth:** Each iteration builds on previous insights. Initial focus on fairness accumulated into understanding social dynamics, which accumulated into recognizing the importance of transparency over pure mathematical accuracy.

**Transformational Growth:** The biggest transformation was realizing CheckMate isn't just a productivity tool - it's reshaping how we communicate about household responsibilities. Conversations became more data-driven and less emotional.

**Fruiting Body:** The app itself is becoming the fruiting body - a visible manifestation of our collective learning about fair collaboration. But more importantly, our improved household dynamics represent the real fruiting: sustainable practices that could spread to other shared living situations.

### Technical Progress

Basic React Native shell is complete with task logging functionality. Working on the weighted scoring algorithm that balances task difficulty with frequency. The challenge is making the math feel fair rather than just mathematically correct.

### Community Impact

Testing with roommates revealed interesting patterns. People game the system initially but gradually develop more genuine participation habits. The transparency creates positive peer pressure without explicit social enforcement.

The mycelial aspect shows in how individual task completion starts connecting household members in unexpected ways - noticing each other's patterns, offering help proactively, and developing appreciation for different contribution styles.
